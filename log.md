# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2018-02-27

**Today's Progress**: Setup python, git and create github account with pycharm, start with pandas datareader

**Thoughts:** Nice try with quandl. It is not clear, when I have to use my API key. But it would be nice to add some graphical stuff for some stocks
